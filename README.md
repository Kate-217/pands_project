# Exploratory Analysis on Iris Dataset

***

Iris flower dataset is a famous material which has been used and analyzed uncountable times by students all over the world. The British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher created it in 1936 year as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Since then this data set has become a classical material for demonstarion statistical algorithms.

## About this project

This project was completed as an assessment for the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University using the original dataset from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). 


## Use of this project

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of Python for data analysis. Additionally, this project showcases how the Jupyter Notebook can be used to perform the analysis in one cohesive document.

## Getting started

To get to know my project, please ensure that you have Python and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. 
I worked on my analysis using **Jupyter Notebook**, but you can use a different editor to open it.

To open my project with **Google colab** you can use the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Kate-217/pands_project/blob/main/iris.ipynb) that was generated with [Open in Colab](https://openincolab.com/).

It is necessary to install additional modules such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. One of the easiest ways to obtain them is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

The original **Iris dataset** was taken from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).
